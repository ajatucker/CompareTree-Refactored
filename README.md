# CompareTree-Refactored
We took the BST.AVL.SplayTrees project and refactored it, removing code smells.

## The overall idea of the project is:
The user is expected to be a developer of some kind, and the software requires understanding of data structures and programming skills to utilize the software. 
The goal is for the user to compare their possible data to help decide the best tree data structure would work best for the type of project they are working on. 
Specifically, the software developed was to compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of different search trees depending on the data, which would help developers decide the tree type. 
The search trees being compared are the AVL Tree, Binary Search Tree, and Splaying Trees respectively. 
A new UI was created to increase usability and functionality for user experience. 
The actual UI has 3 Tree Information Sections that provide information for each respective tree. 
The three sections include one for the AVL, Binary Search Tree, and the Splay trees, and there are 3 buttons for the three main operations, being insert, search, and delete. 
The buttons display differentiated node counts for their respective operations. 
The user enters an integer above each button and presses the corresponding button to display the results. 
As this is done, the results of the operations are displayed in a log file called TreeLog.
